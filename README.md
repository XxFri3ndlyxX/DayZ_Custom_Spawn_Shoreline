# DayZ_Custom_Spawn_Shoreline
Custom Player Spawn Point On The Shoreline near a boat.

This will add several spawn point on the shoreline near a small boat from the top right of the map all the way to the bottom left of the map.

So basically i cover the entire shoreline.

The idea behind this was to make it appear as if you were on a cruze ship and some faillure happen and you had to evacuate by small boat. 

Then you got to Chernarus and you soon realized that your are on your own as it's the end of the world. Zombies are real. You MUST do everything in your power to survive.
